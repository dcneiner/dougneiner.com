# About me

Hey, I'm Doug. I've been coding since our family was given a Commodore 64 and I discovered BASIC when I was a kid. One of my first websites heavily used frames and I wasn't opposed to using FrontPage. I've been working in design and development professionally for close to 20 years. Even though I enjoy all aspects of web technology (backends, databases, deployment) my career has focused largely on the front-end and design.
