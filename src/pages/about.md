# About me

Hey, I'm Doug. I've been coding since our family was given a Commodore 64 and I discovered BASIC when I was a kid. One of my first websites heavily used frames and at least one of them used FrontPage extensions! I've been working in design and development professionally for about 19 years. Even though I enjoy all aspects of web technology (backends, databases, deployment) my career has focused largely on the front-end and design.

I am a Principal Software Engineer at [Planview](https://www.planview.com/) working on their Global Design System Team. All opinions expressed on this site are my own and may not reflect the opinions of Planview.
