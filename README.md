# My personal site

Welcome! Its been _years_ since I've done anything with my primary domain of https://dougneiner.com, or what was supposed to be my coding focused site at http://code.dougneiner.com. So my hope is this repository will soon become my new website.

For a while, my hobbies centered almost solely around woodworking. You can find that stuff at https://dnhandcrafted.com if you are interested.

## Open source and knowledge sharing

I don't have a formal computer science background, so I'd be most commonly described as a self-taught software engineer. However, that term "self-taught" has never sat well with me. While I _have_ learned a lot on my own, those learnings are continually intertwined and influenced by all the amazing people who have freely shared their knowledge, experiments and musings.

In that vein, my current plan is to develop this site in public with the source of the site MIT licensed. I still need to make a decision about the _content_ of the site, so I'll update the README appropriately once I've taken that decision.

This isn't entirely out of good will â€“ I'm hoping there is a real chance I get some constructive feedback from others that can help make what I am doing even better!

## About the tech

I've used a number of static site generators over the years, but I've heard good things about [Astro](https://astro.build/) and decided to use it for this project. (I've also had good luck with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) for my [hobby woodworking site](https://dnhandcrafted.com/)).

I have no idea if I'll manage to keep this list up to date, but here goes nothing:

## About me

Hey, I'm Doug. I've been coding since our family was given a Commodore 64 and I discovered BASIC when I was a kid. One of my first websites heavily used frames and I wasn't opposed to using FrontPage back then. I've been working in design and development professionally for close to 20 years. Even though I enjoy all aspects of web technology (backends, databases, deployment) my career has focused largely on the front-end and design.

You can find me on [Twitter/X](https://x.com/dougneiner) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dougneiner/).
