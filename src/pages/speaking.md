# Speaking

I'm a geek at heart, and love talking about technology with others. I've spoken at a number of conferences around the world and especially value the moments where something I've shared has helped an attendee grow. My presentation style is typically fast-paced and focused on practical learning that can be immediately applied in day-to-day work.

## Upcoming events

_I am not currently scheduled for any conferences. Feel free to [reach out](/about#contact) if you'd like me to consider speaking at your event._

## Past events

Between increased travel for work, a growing family, [fun hobbies](https://dnhandcrafted.com), and of course the pandemic,Â I've taken an eight-year hiatus from speaking. But here are some of the conferences I've spoken at in the past.
